# Fraud Detection and Target Marketing Projects

## Introduction
Explore the dynamic world of machine learning through our projects on Fraud Detection and Target Marketing. This repository highlights the use of Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, employing hyperparameter tuning techniques to enhance model precision and effectiveness.

## Objective
The primary objectives of these projects include:
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers by adjusting at least three hyperparameters for each model.
* **Search Techniques**: Utilize random and grid search methodologies, along with cross-validation, to enhance model performance.
* **Parameter Optimization**: Identify effective hyperparameter ranges for both classifiers, addressing the unique challenges in Fraud Detection and Target Marketing.
* **Performance Evaluation**: Compare classifiers using the test set, determining the optimal classifier based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
### Insurance Fraud Dataset (Fraud Detection)
The Insurance Fraud dataset, designed for detecting fraudulent activities in the insurance sector, is available in the repository as a zip file. It includes a variety of features related to insurance claims, policyholder information, and historical data, facilitating the development of effective machine learning models for fraud detection.

### Portuguese Bank Dataset (Target Marketing)
The Portuguese Bank dataset, intended for target marketing analysis in the banking sector, is also available in the repository as a zip file. This dataset contains features related to clients' banking behaviors, financial attributes, and communication history, serving as a valuable resource for predictive modeling to identify potential clients for targeted marketing campaigns and optimize resource allocation.

## Results
The analysis results demonstrate significant insights and advancements in both projects.

### Fraud Detection Results
* Hyperparameter tuning greatly improves classifier performance.
* Enhanced accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score strengthen the fraud detection system.
* The refined model, detailed in the documentation, shows improved capabilities in identifying fraudulent activities.

### Target Marketing Results
* Hyperparameter tuning of classifiers results in models with better predictive accuracy.
* Improved classifiers contribute to more effective target marketing strategies.
* Comprehensive evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are detailed in the project documentation.
